# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_POPULAR_MOVIES_DATA

In collaboration with UNP, I worked on the Popular Movies Dashboard, a comprehensive tool that analyzes movie trends, audience preferences, and performance metrics. The dashboard examines the total number of films, their genre distribution, and showcases the highest-rated and most popular titles. It provides insights into average ratings, rating distribution, and user engagement by highlighting which movies receive the most reviews. Additionally, the project explores popular genres and tags, tracking trends over time to understand shifting audience interests. On the financial side, it evaluates top-grossing movies, revenue patterns, and the correlation between ratings and box office success. This data-driven approach offers valuable insights into what makes a movie successful, aiding in better content recommendations and strategic decision-making in the film industry.
